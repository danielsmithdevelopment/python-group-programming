# python-group-programming
This repository is set up to organize collaborators and code for the Python coding group. This should be a place to learn and ask questions related to Python development etc.

## How to collaborate in this repo
**Issues** will be created that represent pieces of functionality needing to be worked on. 
- To work on an issue, select one and identify its issue number. 
- Then create a branch from the development branch with your name and the issue number. 
- Work on the issue and when ready to submit, open a Pull request from your branch into the development branch. 
- This pull request will have reviewers assigned so the code can be checked. 
- Once reviewed and approved it is ready to be merged in. 

## Branches
- The **development** branch will sometimes contain breaking code and will need to be fixed. 
- The **master** branch will have the lastest up to date tested code and should never be broken.
- **Issue branches** have the issue numbers in their name along with the name of the collaborator working on that issue.
