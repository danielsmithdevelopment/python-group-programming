# Discord Server Planning

Below is a summary of the current plans for the Python Group Programming Discord server.

### Bot Functionalities:

- Activity monitor bot to remind users to stay active and/or provide resources for help when they've become stuck.
- Twitter bot to track certain popular topics/users and comment on tweets with link to join Discord server.

### Server Growth TODOs:
- Re-engage with current users directly to promote activity and involvement with server as well as to announce new/upcoming content.
